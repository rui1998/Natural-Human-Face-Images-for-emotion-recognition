# Natural-Human-Face-Images-for-emotion-recognition
About Dataset  Edit Context Facial expression recognition generally use standard datasets like FER, CK+ and KDEF for machine learning. Here is an attempt to provide additional data for real human faces gathered from the internet and annotated manually.  Content There are 8400 + images with 7 emotions categories â€“ anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness and surprise. All images contain grayscale human face (or sketch). Each image is 224 x 224 pixel grayscale in PNG format.  Acknowledgements Images are sourced from the internet where they are freely available for download e.g. Google, Unsplash, Flickr etc.  Inspiration With a humble purpose to make more annotated data available for use by machine learning based Facial Expression Recognition. There would be a definite scope for improvement in the manual annotation.
